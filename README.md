# plane (name is WIP to avoid trademark issues temporarily)

A simple experimental Python wrapper for the Ravy API.

This is currently a work in progress state. Since this is a first experience as a developer working on an API wrapper, this might not utilize the best Python practices. If you see anything that needs to be changed, feel free to create a pull request!

This API is heavily inspired and is based upon the [ksoftapi Python wrapper](https://github.com/KSoft-Si/ksoftapi.py).
