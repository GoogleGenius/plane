A simple experimental Python wrapper for the Ravy API.

This is currently a work in progress state. Since this is a first experience as a developer working on an API wrapper, this might not utilize the best Python practices. If you see anything that needs to be changed, feel free to create a pull request!

This API is heavily inspired and is based upon the [ksoftapi Python wrapper](https://github.com/KSoft-Si/ksoftapi.py). The license will be updated by the full release in order to reflect this.

TODO:
[ ] Abstract responses to objects
[ ] Full API coverage
[ ] More flexibility
[ ] Public documentation
[ ] Unit tests

DONE:
[x] Basic HTTP requests functionality
[x] Few API functionalities/endpoints
[x] Docstrings (so far)
