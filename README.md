A simple experimental Python wrapper for the Ravy API.

This is currently a work in progress state. Since this is a first experience as a developer working on an API wrapper, this might not utilize the best Python practices. If you see anything that needs to be changed, feel free to create a pull request!

This API is heavily inspired and is partially based upon the [ksoftapi Python wrapper](https://github.com/KSoft-Si/ksoftapi.py). Parts of the client and HTTP client were modified off of this, as well as the model interface designs.

TODO:

- [ ] Full API coverage
- [ ] More flexibility
- [ ] Unit tests

DONE:

- [x] Basic HTTP requests functionality
- [x] Few API functionalities/routes
- [x] Docstrings (so far)
- [x] Public documentation
- [x] Abstract responses to objects
